A loading screen with animation displays on app launch, transitions to the main gallery after 2.5 seconds, and the gallery shows cars and engines with 'Buy Now' buttons and pricing. The design follows a premium automotive showroom theme with metallic color palettes, proper typography, and consistent styling across all views.",
